[![DOI](https://img.shields.io/badge/DOI-10.1017%2Fpsy.2025.10031-blue)](https://doi.org/10.1017/psy.2025.10031)

This repository provides R code implementing an extension of the Transition Diagnostic Classification Model (TDCM; Matthew & Bradshaw, 2018) using P贸lya-Gamma data augmentation. The method enables flexible longitudinal modeling of student attribute mastery with covariate-dependent transitions, as described in:

## Features

- Supports longitudinal diagnostic classification modeling
- Implements log-linear cognitive diagnosis model (LCDM) for the item response component
- Incorporates covariates into attribute transition modeling between time points
- Employs P贸lya-Gamma augmentation for efficient Gibbs sampling
- Demonstrated via simulation and empirical examples

## Working with Repository

To replicate the results in the manuscript or run the extended TDCM model on new data, see the main R script in the repository and refer to simulated/empirical data examples.
